**"YOLO-MDEW: Improved YOLOv8 for Application of Wood Board Edge Banding Defect Detection"**

Submitted to *PLOS ONE*, 2025.

## 🧠 Overview

YOLO-MDEW is a lightweight and accurate object detection model specifically optimized for identifying wood board edge banding defects.  It is based on YOLOv8 with the following architectural improvements:

- 🧩 **C2f-MCFF Module**: Enhances multi-scale feature fusion.
- 🔁 **SPPF-D**: A lightweight version of spatial pyramid pooling.
- 🧠 **ELA Attention Mechanism**: Improved focus on defect regions.
- 📐 **WIoU Loss**: More precise bounding box regression.
